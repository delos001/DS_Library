## Basic Info
SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that 
doesn’t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database 
using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can 
use SQLite for internal data storage. 

It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the 
code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle

from command prompt type: sqlite3
this will bring you to transient in-memory database
