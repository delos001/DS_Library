## General Strategy
- Perform Principal FA with varimax rotation
- Perform iterative principal FA with varimax rotation
- Perform maximum likelihood FA with varimax rotation
- Compare colustions: 
  + did each FA yeild roughly same factor loadings?
  + is one set of factors more interpretable?
- Evaluate factor loadings over a range of common factors.  ie: instead of just looking at k=4, also consider values for k in {2,3,4,5,6}
- If you have enough data, evaluate prospective factor loadings through bootstrap or cross validation (to see if the results are consistent between different samples).  ie: 70% test, 30% train sampling
