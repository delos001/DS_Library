# A variation from Holtâ€™s linear trend method is achieved by 
# allowing the level and the slope to be multiplied rather than added

# alpha is smoothing paramenter, beta controls the trend component



# an exponential fit, but this one is damped to control a constant 
# exponential growth or decline trend. (note graph below with project lines)
