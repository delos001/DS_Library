## Notes


```
KNN classifier predicts the class of a given test observation by identifying the observations that are nearest to it, 
the scale of the variables matters.

Part of the class library
different from other model fitting functions that require 2 step: 1: fit model, 2: use model to make predictions
knn() performs predictions in single command based on 4 inputs:
1. A matrix containing the predictors associated with the training data, labeled train.X below.
2. A matrix containing the predictors associated with the data for which we wish to make predictions, labeled test.X below.
3. A vector containing the class labels for the training observations, labeled train.Direction below.
4. A value for K, the number of nearest neighbors to be used by the classifier.
