## Notes


- CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS: probabilities calculated by AUC
  + Exponential
    + steadily decreaing, skewed right (zero to infinity), apex = 0
    + Exponential distribution is similar to Poisson (except exponential is continuous)
    + Describes probability distribution of the times between random occurrences
  + Normal (Gaussian)
    + symetrical about mean, asumptomatic to h-axis, unimodal, AUC = 1
  + Uniform
    + Area = length x height, mean = (a + b)/2
- DISCRETE: can't have integer/decimal outcomes
  + Binomial
    + Assumes n identical and independent trials, with 2 possible outcomes
    + p and q terms remain constant (p is prob of success and q is prob of failure)
  + Hypergeometric
  + Poisson
