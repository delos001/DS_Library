## Notes

- Lists are entered using the [] and can be number, strings, or a combination of both.  
- Lists can also be created by arguments.


- Set comprehensions are similar to lists but can represent a subset of a list
- Sets don't contain duplicates
- Sets can support union, intersection, difference, etc

- Dictionary comprehensions are sets containing a key that maps a value to one or more elements.
