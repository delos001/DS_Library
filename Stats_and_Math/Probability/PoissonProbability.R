# If there are twelve cars crossing a bridge per minute on average, 
#   find the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing 
#   the bridge in a particular minute.
# Therefore:
# lower tail test: The probability of having sixteen or less cars 
#   crossing the bridge in a particular minute is given by the function ppois.
ppois(16,Â lambda=12)


# uppter tail test: Hence the probability of having seventeen or more cars 
#   crossing the bridge in a minute is in the upper tail of the probability 
#   density function.
ppois(16, lambda=12, lower=FALSE)
