Which is better, LOOCV or K-fold CV?
LOOCV is more computationally intensive than K-fold CV
From the perspective of bias reduction, LOOCV is preferred to K-fold CV (when K < n)
However, LOOCV has higher variance than K-fold CV (when K < n)
Thus, we see the bias-variance trade-off between the two resampling methods
