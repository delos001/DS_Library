## Basics:
#### Single Linear Regression
- H0 : B1=0  Null hypothesis where B1 is the slope: 
  + so we are saying for the null hypothesis is that there is no slope to the regression line
- H1 : B1<>0 Alterntaive hypothesis: 
  + says there is a slope to the regression line (which indicates a relationship between the two variables)
  
#### Multiple Linear Regression
- H0 : B1=B2=â€¦=Bk=0  Null hypothesis for multivariable regression
- H1 : Bj<>0 for at least one j  Alternative hypothesis: 
  + slope of at least one of the regressor variables is not equal to zero (and therefore there is a relationship between regressor and response variable)
